Instead of using the clearfix hack, we use flexbox to achieve the same result.  Flexbox provides a more robust and reliable way to manage layout, especially when dealing with floating elements. Below is the corrected code:

/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
display: flex;
}
.float-left {
float: left;
}
/*No clearfix hack needed*/
