This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue with the clearfix hack in CSS.  The expected behavior is for the clearfix to properly clear floated elements. However, in this case, the floats unexpectedly overlap, causing layout problems. The bug.css file showcases the problem, while bugSolution.css offers a potential solution.  The solution explores alternative methods to clear floats, demonstrating a more reliable approach.
