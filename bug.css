The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when dealing with floating elements. Specifically, the clearfix hack (adding :after pseudo-element with content: ""; display: block; clear: both;) is not working as expected. It seems that the floating elements are overlapping or not clearing properly, leading to unexpected layout issues.
